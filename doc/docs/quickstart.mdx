# Quickstart

## Install the package

```bash
npm install oura-node-editor
```

## Basic component

```typescript
import { NodeEditor, PinLayout, useNodeEditor } from "oura-node-editor";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function BasicNodeEditorDisplayer() {
  const {
    nodes,
    links,
    panZoomInfo,
    selectedItems,
    setNodes,
    onNodeMove,
    setPanZoomInfo,
    setSelectedItems,
    onConnectorUpdate,
  } = useNodeEditor();

  useEffect(() => {
    setNodes({
      addition: {
        name: "addition",
        position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
        width: 100,
        connectors: {
          result: {
            name: "result",
            pinLayout: PinLayout.RIGHT_PIN,
            contentType: "none",
            data: {},
          },
          a: {
            name: "a",
            pinLayout: PinLayout.NO_PINS,
            contentType: "number",
            data: { value: 0 },
          },
          b: {
            name: "b",
            pinLayout: PinLayout.NO_PINS,
            contentType: "number",
            data: { value: 10 },
          },
        },
      },
    });
  }, [setNodes]);

  return (
    <NodeEditor
      panZoomInfo={panZoomInfo}
      nodes={nodes}
      links={links}
      onConnectorUpdate={onConnectorUpdate}
      selectedItems={selectedItems}
      onPanZoomInfo={setPanZoomInfo}
      onSelectedItems={setSelectedItems}
      onNodeMove={onNodeMove}
    />
  );
}
```

## Node editor logic

As today, oura-node-editor focus on the UI side and is just in charge to display node editors.
The logic of computation / functional behaviour has to be written and can be complex.
Later in the project, this may be implemented and given to the easelly user.
The project [oura-canvas-creator](https://github.com/mathieuguyot/oura-canvas-creator) gives a complex example of a node/edge propagation algorithm (even with reusable node and edges functions blocs). The logic is located in [node.ts file](https://github.com/mathieuguyot/oura-canvas-creator/blob/main/src/nodes/node.ts) and propagateAll or propagateNode functions (Warning, this is experimental and can contains bugs).

## Change theme

oura-node-editor uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). To consult themes provided by daisyUI, go [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).
As stated in documentation, on your index.html file, add data-theme attribute to html tag  to set the theme you wish to use.

## More complex use cases

The project [oura-canvas-creator](https://github.com/mathieuguyot/oura-canvas-creator) was created mainly to test all features provided by oura-node-editor. 
Do not hesitate to look at how the project is made. In particular, the project allow to user to:
- create and remove nodes
- create edges
- implement connectors to be reused in nodes (canvas, 3d view)
- implement node logic as expained above
